# AllegoryNow

A clean, responsive civic-research website for the AllegoryNow Family Court
inquiry. The site includes a concentric Tree of Inquiry, a separate searchable
claim list, an exhibit library, project background pages, discussion rules, a
contribution form, and a server-protected content editor.

See [ADMIN-GUIDE.md](ADMIN-GUIDE.md) for the exact files to edit, the safe
publishing routine, and the recommended architecture for a future private
administrator panel.

The application is being migrated from a full-stack Cloudflare Worker to one
Hostinger Node.js application. Both builds use the same public pages and the
same-origin `/admin`, CMS, comments, and contribution routes. The Hostinger
runtime stores structured data and private contribution files in its MySQL
database, so publication never depends on a second domain or deployment.

## Migration architecture

The two build targets remain separate until the Hostinger deployment and data
transfer are verified:

- `npm run build` emits the Cloudflare/Sites Worker rollback copy under `dist/`.
- `npm run build:hostinger` emits the static public site under `out/` and the
  Hostinger Node entry point at `hostinger-dist/server.mjs`.
- `npm start` starts the Hostinger server on Hostinger's injected `PORT`.
- `npm run start:sites` starts the Cloudflare/Vinext build locally.

The Cloudflare export route is disabled unless a temporary `MIGRATION_TOKEN`
exists. The matching Hostinger import route also requires that token. Remove
the token from both environments immediately after the one-time D1/R2 transfer.
See [HOSTINGER-MIGRATION.md](HOSTINGER-MIGRATION.md) for the cutover checklist.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Linux with `flock`, `curl`, and GNU `timeout`

## Cloudflare rollback lifecycle

The Sites lifecycle CLI runs the locked dependency install before returning this checkout. Edit the source under `app/`, then checkpoint when a coherent milestone is ready to inspect or share. The remote Sites builder runs `npm run build` against the pushed commit. Do not repeat install or build as a normal pre-checkpoint step.

This project does not use a separate `wrangler.jsonc`; the hosting manifest and
deployment control plane provide the Worker bindings.

`install:ci` is intentionally a single, non-retrying `npm ci`. It refuses a concurrent install for the same project, consumes a matching image-seeded npm cache with `--prefer-offline` while retaining registry fallback for a missing cache object, otherwise downloads and verifies the complete vinext tarball recorded in `package-lock.json`, limits npm to one socket, and terminates a stalled install. `build` applies a short timeout and then validates the Sites artifact. These helpers target Linux and use GNU `timeout`; they are not native macOS scripts.

Scripts that need writable project-scoped home, npm, XDG, and temporary paths use `scripts/sites-env.sh`. The `dev` and `start` scripts honor the caller's runtime environment and keep Wrangler logs inside the checkout. The generated `.sites-runtime/` directory is disposable and ignored by Git.

## Included shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` provides optional dispatch-owned ChatGPT sign-in helpers
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/index.ts` reads the D1 binding from the Cloudflare Worker environment
- `hostinger/mysql.ts` adapts the CMS and contribution services to Hostinger MySQL
- `hostinger/server.ts` serves the exported pages and all same-origin APIs
- `server/migration.ts` exposes the disabled-by-default, token-protected export
- `db/schema.ts` starts intentionally empty
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle.config.ts` supports local migration generation when needed

## Workspace Auth Headers

OpenAI workspace sites can read the current user's email from
`oai-authenticated-user-email`.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty
`name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs
optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send
  anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- Use `chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)` and `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for
  browser links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in
  or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because
  they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the
OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for
those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain
anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the
Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions,
or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write
actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Diagnostic Commands

- `npm run install:ci`: perform the one bounded lockfile install
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite/Vinext development server
- `npm run build`: build and validate the deployable Sites artifact
- `npm run build:hostinger`: build the Hostinger static site and Node server
- `npm start`: start the built Hostinger application
- `npm run start:sites`: start the built Vinext rollback application
- `npm test`: build, validate, and verify the rendered development-preview metadata
- `npm run test:hostinger`: build and verify Hostinger routes and artifacts
- `npm run validate:artifact`: recheck an existing artifact's manifest and ESM `default.fetch` export
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

Use build and validation commands for targeted diagnosis after a remote failure, not as part of the normal checkpoint path.

The timeout defaults can be overridden for a controlled canary with `SITES_INSTALL_TIMEOUT`, `SITES_INSTALL_KILL_AFTER`, `SITES_BUILD_TIMEOUT`, and `SITES_BUILD_KILL_AFTER`. A timeout fails the command; the helpers never retry an unchanged install or build.
